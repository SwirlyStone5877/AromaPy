# AromaPy
A simple assistant for Aroma written in python because I suck at C.

## Installation
1. This requires Aroma to be installed, of course. If you don't have it, you can find instructions for basic setup [here](https://wiiu.hacks.guide) and the actual package for Aroma [here](https://aroma.foryour.cafe).
2. Download either [the .py file](https://github.com/SwirlyStone5877/AromaPy#the-py-file) or [the .exe file](https://github.com/SwirlyStone5877/AromaPy#the-exe-file).
   ### The .py File
   a. Requires either Visual Studio Code (not recommended[^2]) or Python (the latest version)
     ##### Visual Studio Code
     a. Open the file with Visual Studio Code (if it doesn't ask automatically, right click the file and click "Open With.")
   
     b. Right click the file in Visual Studio Code.
   
     c. Click "Run in Interactive Window."
   
     d. Enjoy if it works!
     ##### Python
     a. Open the file.
   
     b. Done.
   ### The .exe File
   a. Open the file.
   
   b. Done.
## Usage
This relies on a command prompt to work. It uses the keyboard, and not the mouse. It uses numbers. The options include the following:
1. [x] 

## Contributions
If you'd like to team up with me, I'm open to contributions, but I won't be active at times. For a long time? For a short time? Who knows? It's random.

## Info
It's a work in progress, so it isn't done yet. But you can see the updated progress here (if I remember).
